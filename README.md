**Text-to-Image Generation**
This repository includes two implementations for generating images from text prompts using the Stable Diffusion model:

**Jupyter Notebook (text_to_image.ipynb):** A Jupyter Notebook for generating and displaying images from text prompts.
**Streamlit App (text_to_image.py):** A Streamlit application for generating and displaying images through a web interface.
**Overview
Jupyter Notebook (text_to_image.ipynb)**
The Jupyter Notebook allows you to interactively generate and display images from text descriptions. It is useful for quick experimentation and visualization within a notebook environment.

**Streamlit App (text_to_image.py)**
The Streamlit app provides a user-friendly web interface for generating images from text prompts. Users can input text and view the generated images directly in their web browser.

**Requirements**
Ensure you have the following packages installed:

diffusers
torch
Pillow
streamlit (for the Streamlit app)
ipywidgets (for Jupyter Notebook)
